# Gilbert John Gallega - React with API using Node Express

## Dependecies I downloaded :
* npm init y
* npm install express
* npm install --save-dev nodemon
* npm install body-parser
* npm install uuid
* npm install axios
  

## How to know that the is running and can make request

1. Run the react file in the web by typing  npm run dev , after that click the localhost and it will go directly to your web
2. In running the server type  **node index.js**   in the terminal after that you will see  `http://localhost:4000 `
   you can click it to direct you the browser or you can copy it and paste it to thunder client or postman
3. Once you paste it and you can see that it is working , you can now make request

4. Get `http://localhost:4000/users ` to return all the list of users
5. Get  `http://localhost:4000/user/< specific id >` to return the user with specfic id
6. Post  `http://localhost:4000/user ` to add another users , you dont need to put id because it is auto generated by uuid
7. Delete  `http://localhost:4000/user/< specific id > ` to remove user with specific id
8. Put `http://localhost:4000/user/< specific id >` to update user with specific id

if you want to check if you successfully perform POST,DELETE,PUT  you can check it by GET all the list of user or with specific id
